# Big Data Analysis with R 

This is the repository for the course taught at the University of Regensburg in Summer 2020.

You can find the syllabus in the folder 'syllabus,' the scripts in the folder 'scripts,' solutions in 'scripts/solutions,' and the files for practicing data import in 'import_training_files.'

If you are one of my students, and you are looking for scripts, instructions, etc., I would recommend you to rather check out this repo than GRIPS, as it is updated in more or less real time while GRIPS is only being updated once in a while.
