# 1. Find the duplicated movie. How could you go across this?
# 2. Which director has made the longest movie?
# 3. What's the highest ranked movie?
# 4. Which movie got the most votes?
# 5. Which movie had the biggest revenue in 2016?
# 6. How much revenue made the movies in the dataset every year in total?
